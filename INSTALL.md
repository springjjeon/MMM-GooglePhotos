### Stop token from expiring every week
as of 2021, it appears tokens only last 1 week while in 'testing'. This led to users needing to get a new token.json every ~week to 10 days. To get your app out of testing mode, where the token will last indefinately:

1. go to your google cloud console, select your magic mirror project. Then from the navigation menu(top left) -> APIs & Services -> Oath consent screen. This should get you to a site something like https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent?project=[PROJECT_ID] where [PROJECT_ID] is the project ID. This is where the publishing status. It looks like this:

2. click Publish app and review permissions as necessary.
